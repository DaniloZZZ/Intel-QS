# Intel Quantum Simulator

The Intel Quantum Simulator (IQS), also known as qHiPSTER (the Quantum High Performance Software Testing Environment), has been moved to the following project repository  https://github.com/iqusoftl/intel-qs, which will be further maintained by the current developers [Justin Hogaboam](justin.w.hogaboam@intel.com),
[Gian Giacomo Guerreschi](gian.giacomo.guerreschi@intel.com), and
[Fabio Baruffa](fabio.baruffa@intel.com)

This is an open-source project and we welcome contributions for new features or applications.
If your project relies on IQS for simulation, contact us since we are selecting a few external repositories to recommend to the usersâ€™ community.
